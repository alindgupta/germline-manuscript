  Cilia are sensory organelles that are important for human development
  and physiology.
  A large number of genetic disorders affecting cilia are associated with
  mutations in proteins that localize to the transition zone (TZ),
  a structure at the base of cilia required for ciliogenesis and
  regulation of trafficking in and out of the cilium.
  Here, we report that the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate(\PIP{}) is essential for proper maturation and function
  of TZs in the male \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} germline.
  Reduction of cellular \PIP{} levels by expression of the
  \textit{Salmonella} phosphoinositide phosphatase SigD or mutation of
  the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKI) Skittles (Sktl)
  induces hyperelongation of TZs following their docking at the plasma
  membrane.
  We provide evidence that these hyperelongated TZs are functionally
  defective, and that the Exo84 mutant \textit{onion rings}
  \textit{onr} decouples TZ hyperelongation from the role for
  \PIP{} in cilium-membrane tethering.
  Our observations reveals a requirement for \PIP{} at the base of cilia
  in regulating TZ length and function.

\section{Introduction}
Cilia are sensory organelles present on almost all cells in the human body
\citep{satir2010primary}.
They function primarily by providing sensory inputs to cells, but can
also function as motile propellers in certain cells
\citep{bloodgood2010sensory}.
Consistent with their importance in cell signalling,
defects in cilium formation are associated with genetic disorders
known collectively as ciliopathies, which can display
neurological defects \citep{valente2014primary},
skeletal abnormalities \citep{hammarsjo2017novel, waters2011ciliopathies},
and infertility \citep{inaba2016sperm} in addition to other phenotypes.

A large number of ciliopathies are linked to mutations in proteins that
localize to the cilium transition zone (referred to herein as TZ).
The TZ is the proximal-most region of the cilium and
acts as a diffusion barrier that regulates the
bi-directional transport of protein and lipid cargo at the base of the cilium
\citep{reiter2012base, szymanska2012transition}.
The TZ is essential for cilium formation (ciliogenesis) and cilium-associated
signalling.
The conserved TZ protein CEP290, for example, is mutated in at least
six different ciliopathies, and is essential for cilium formation in both humans
and Drosophila \citep{basiri2014migrating}.
Although the protein composition of TZs has been investigated in various
studies ranging from single gene analysis to proteomics,
processes underlying TZ maturation are not as well-studied.

In the Drosophila male germline, nascent TZs first assemble on basal bodies
during G2 phase in spermatocytes and anchor to the plasma membrane.
This is followed by establishment of cilium-membrane connections
through a poorly understood mechanism
involving microtubule rearrangements \citep{gottardo2013cilium} and a
ciliary membrane that persists through meiosis \citep{riparbelli2012assembly}.
Ciliogenesis begins with the assembly of TZ proteins at the tips of
the nascent basal body.
This is followed by the anchoring of the TZ to the membrane and
establishment of a compartmentalized space bounded by the ciliary membrane
and the TZ.
TZ maturation has been described in
\textit{Paramecium} \citep{aubusson2015transition}
\textit{Caenorrhabditis elegans} \citep{serwas2017centrioles} and
\textit{Drosophila melanogaster} \citep{gottardo2013cilium}
and is most readily observed by an increase in TZ length from nascent to mature.
This are probably similar to the initial steps of TZ assembly and reorganization
in vertebrates.

Here, we show that the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (\PIP{})
is essential for proper TZ maturation in developing male germ cells in \textit{D. melanogaster}.
\PIP{} is a membrane lipid and one of seven phosphoinositides (PIPs)
present in eukaryotic cells.
It is primarily enriched at the plasma membrane and the base of cilia,
but its functions in ciliogenesis have not been studied.
We found that reduction of cellular \PIP{}
by expression of the bacterial PIP phosphatase SigD
or by inactivation of the PIP 5-kinase Skittles (Sktl) that localizes to cilia
induces longer than normal TZs without affecting TZ assembly.
These hyperelongated TZs show hallmarks of aberrant function similar to those
found in previously studied TZ mutants,
including loss of cilium-membrane associations.
We also find that the \textit{onion rings} allele of the
ciliopathy-associated \textit{EXOC8} gene encoding the human Exo84
decouples TZ hyperelongation from loss of cilium-membrane contacts.
Our results suggest that the plasma membrane lipid \PIP{} regulates TZ length,
maturation and function, acting to support ciliogenesis.


\section{Results}
\subsection{\PIP{} is essential for transition zone maturation}
To investigate whether reduction of cellular \PIP{} affects ciliogenesis in the
Drosophila male germline,
we used transgenic flies expressing the Salmonella phosphoinositide phosphatase SigD
under the $\beta$2-tubulin promoter (referred to herein as \sigd{}),
which is expressed exclusively in spermatocytes
\citep{wei2008depletion, fabian2010phosphatidylinositol}.
We previously showed that \sigd{} induces male sterility
due in part to defects in flagellar biosynthesis \citep{wei2008depletion}.
To understand whether this was due to aberrant TZ function,
we examined the localization of fluorescently-labelled
centriolar/basal body protein
Ana1 (CEP295 homolog) \citep{goshima2007genes, blachon2009proximal}
and the TZ protein Cep290 \citep{basiri2014migrating}
during early steps of cilium assembly in spermatocytes in both
wild-type controls and \sigd{}.
As shown in Figure 1A, Cep290 grew to much longer lengths in \sigd{}
compared to wild-type controls.
Ana1 lengths were not affected, and we did not observe an inverse
correlation between Cep290 and Ana1 length.
This phenotype was not specific to Cep290;
all TZ markers examined showed hyperelongation, including
acetylated tubulin \citep{gottardo2013cilium},
Chibby \citep{enjolras2012drosophila} and
MKS \citep{slaats2015mks1, vieillard2016transition} proteins (Figure 1).
TZ hyperelongation was a highly penetrant phenotype (\textgreater 90\%)
and showed high intra-cyst correlation (\textgreater 0.95) suggestive
of a dosage-based response to a shared cellular factor.
Hyperelongated TZs persisted through meiosis.
Despite TZ hyperlongation, however, axonemes were able to
elongate post-meiosis (Figure 1).
As we showed previously, the ultrastructure of these axonemes
was frequently aberrant,
either lacking symmetry completely or containing triplet microtubules instead of doublets
\citep{wei2008depletion}.

\subsection{The type I PIP kinase Skittles localizes to centrioles and regulates TZ length}
While \PIP{} is the major substrate for SigD in eukaryotic cells \textit{in vivo}
\citep{terebiznik2002elimination, zhou2001salmonella, sengupta2013depletion},
SigD can also dephosphorylate other PIPs \textit{in vitro}
\citep{norris1998sopb}.
To address whether TZ hyperelongation observed in \sigd{} represented a
physiologically relevant phenotype in response to decreased \PIP{},
we attempted to rescue it by
co-expressing fluorescently-tagged full-length Sktl (Sktl) with SigD
under the same promoter.
We found that Sktl expression was able to suppress TZ elongation in a cilium-autonomous
manner (Figure 2A and B).
We also found that \textit{sktl} clones using Flp/FRT-based mitotic recombination
showed penetrant TZ hyperelongation (Figure 2C).

Since Sktl expression suppressed TZ hyperelongation,
we investigated whether Sktl could localize to centrioles or cilia in the Drosophila germline.
Similar to the human PIPKI$\gamma$ isoform \citep{xu2014pipkigamma},
we found that Sktl localizes to basal bodies in the Drosophila male germline.
As shown in Figure 2, Drosophila PIPKIs arose from the recent duplication of
the ancestral PIPKI gene, and are not orthologous to specific vertebrate PIPKI isoforms.
Sktl has diverged more than its paralog PIP5K59B, and seems
to be functionally related to PIPKI$\gamma$ in its roles at cilia.
However, unlike the human PIPKI$\gamma$, which functions to license TZ assembly
by promoting CP110 removal from basal bodies \citep{xu2016phosphatidylinositol},
our results suggest that Sktl functions in
regulating TZ length in the Drosophila male germline
but not its assembly.
Cp110 is dispensable for cilium formation in Drosophila \citep{franz2013cp110}
and we found its localization to be unaffected in \sigd{} (supplementary figure 1).

\subsection{Hyperelongated transition zones show signs of functional defects}
While shorter spermatocyte TZs have been reported in mutants of TZ proteins in Drosophila
\citep{vieillard2016transition, pratt2016drosophila},
no genetic manipulation has been reported to induce hyperelongated TZs.
We sought to examine whether TZ hyperelongation due to SigD expression
affected TZ function.
During germ cell elongation following meiosis, the TZ detaches from
the basal body and migrates along the growing axoneme, maintaining a ciliary compartment
at the distal-most ~5$\mu$m where tubulin is presumably incorporated into the axoneme.
We found that
TZs that assembled in \sigd{} cells are non-migratory despite the growth of the
axoneme and the cell membrane, as shown by Unc and Cep290 localization.
We previously described ``comet-shaped'' localization of Unc-GFP in these cells,
and we find that these hyperelongated Unc signals persist into cellular elongation
despite elongation of the axoneme.

%% reword this, paragraph is garbage
We previously described the presence of occasional triplet microtubules
in electron micrographs of axonemes from \sigd{} \citep{wei2008depletion}.
While centrioles and basal bodies contain microtubule triplets,
restriction of the C-tubule at the TZ causes the axoneme to
consist of microtubule doublets rather than triplets throughout its length.
Consistent with a defect in TZ barrier formation and presence of
microtubule triplets in axonemes,
we observed that a subset of cilia in \sigd{}
contained puncta of Ana1, a core centriolar protein, at the tips
of TZs marked with Cep290.
This TZ-distal Ana1 localization is observed at a relatively low penetrance
and high intra-cyst correlation.
We found that treatment of germ cells with Paclitaxel as in \citep{riparbelli2013unique}
could increase the penetrance of this phenotype.
Paclitaxel treatment stabilizes microtubules and is thought to disrupt TZ maturation
by interrupting microtubule rearrangements, and similarly induces much longer cilia.
Paclitaxel treatment alone did not induce this phenotype in wild-type controls in our hands
at varying concentrations ($p$ <0.01 with 5\% penetrance),
suggesting that loss of \PIP{} acts upstream of or prior to microtubule rearrangement.
Triplet microtubules within the axoneme are also observed in Taxol-treated cells \citep{riparbelli2013unique}.
It is possible that the TZ defect allows C-tubules and some centriolar proteins
to migrate with it to the distal end.
We did not observe this behaviour with Asterless,
a migratory protein that localizes to the outer
ring of centrioles ($p$ <0.01).

\subsection{The \textit{onion rings} mutant decouples defects found in cells with reduced levels of \PIP{}}
A heterozygous mutation in the human \textit{EXOC8},
the human ortholog of yeast Exo84, is linked to
Joubert syndrome \citep{dixon2012exome}.
Exo84 is a component of the octameric exocyst complex, which binds
\PIP{} and regulates membrane trafficking at the plasma membrane.
We previously showed that male flies homozygous for the \textit{onion rings}
(\textit{onr}) mutant of Drosophila Exo84 were sterile, with phenotypes
similar to \sigd{} \citep{wei2008depletion}.
To investigate whether defects in TZ hyperelongation could be explained by
defective Exo84 function, we examined TZs in \textit{onr} mutants.
We found that the \textit{onr} mutant did not display hyperelongated TZs (Figure 5),
suggesting that Exo84 is dispensable for TZ maturation.

Due to the involvement of exocyst in membrane trafficking at the plasma membrane,
we examined whether cilium-associated membrane dynamics were affected in \sigd{}
or \textit{onr} mutants similar to \textit{dila; cby} mutants
\citep{vieillard2016transition}.
We found that while TZs in \sigd{} and \textit{onr} cells anchored properly
to the plasma membrane, they were unable to either establish or maintain
membrane connections, and were rendered cytoplasmic (Figure 5) similar to
\textit{dila; cby} mutants.
Although we were not able to determine the localization of Exo84 due to the
lack of available antibodies,
we found that Sec6 and Exo70 localized to the plasma membrane as expected,
but were not enriched at the cilium (Figure 5C).
Our results suggest that the exocyst may act downstream of \PIP{} to
enhance cilium-membrane associations, and that TZ hyperelongation and loss of
membrane-cilium association are genetically separable phenotypes.


\section{Discussion}
Cilia are essential for proper human development, and their disruption
can cause genetic disorders with severities ranging from congenital-
lethal \citep{}
to late onset \citep{}.
A large number of ciliopathies are associated with genes that encode for
proteins that function at the cilium transition zone (TZ).
Often, a single gene is linked to multiple ciliopathies with distinct phenotypes
and severities.
For example, \textit{CEP290} is linked to at least six different
cilium-associated human disorders.
It is likely that these mutations do not completely abolish CEP290
function, and may be affected by genetic modifiers in an affected individual
\citep{zaghloul2010functional}.
Animal models with partial loss of TZ function may therefore provide
insight on intermediate phenotypes associated with human disease.
Here, we found that reduced levels of the membrane lipid \PIP{},
which is known to be enriched at the base of cilia,
affects TZ maturation, but not assembly,
leading to hyperelongated TZs that show signs of functional defects, and
may represent one such modifier for TZ function.

In the Drosophila male germline, TZ maturation follows the initial
assembly of TZ proteins on the nascent basal body in the cytoplasm
followed by anchoring at the plasma membrane.
TZ maturation involves microtubule rearrangements and TZ elongation,
which leads to cilium-membrane attachment.
Loss of \PIP{}, a membrane lipid largely at the plasma membrane,
disrupts this process.
It causes excessive lengthening of the TZ,
and disrupts membrane-cilium connections.
Thus, intermediate steps during TZ maturation require \PIP{}.

We found that the type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate kinase (PIPKI) Skittles
suppresses TZ elongation in \sigd{} cells in a cilium-autonomous
manner.
We also found that cells mutant for \textit{sktl} contained hyperelongated
TZs similar to SigD-expressing cells.
Sktl also localizes to centrioles,
and our results suggest that Skittles acts locally at cilia to
regulate TZ length.
PIPKI$\gamma$ is linked to lethal congenital contractural syndrome
type 3 (LCCS3).
It has previously been suggested that LCCS3 might represent a ciliopathy.
PIPKI$\gamma$ is linked to LCCS3 with features reminiscent
of ciliopathies such as micrognathia, and a role for the LCCS1 protein
Gle3 in cilia.
In addition, all three human PIPKI isoforms are highly expressed in testes
and PIPKI$\alpha$ and PIPKI$\beta$ are important for fertility in mice
\citep{hasegawa2012phosphatidylinositol}.

Members of the exocyst complex, such as Sec10 and Sec6, have been shown
to be important for cilium formation in cultured cell lines and zebrafish
\citep{zuo2009exocyst, lobo2017exocyst, seixas2016arl13b}.
The exocyst is known to bind to \PIP{}
\citep{he2007exo70, zhang2008membrane}, and we previously described that
the \textit{onr} allele of Drosophila \textit{Exo84} phenocopied
male germline defects observed in \sigd{} \citep{fabian2010phosphatidylinositol}.
In this paper, we show that the \textit{onr} allele of the Drosophila Exo84
phenocopies the loss of cilium-membrane contacts in \sigd{},
but not TZ hyperelongation.
Proper TZ function is required for membrane tethering, as \textit{dila; cby}
mutants, which contain abnormal TZs also show cytoplasmic cilia similar to
\sigd{} \citep{vieillard2016transition}.
Our results suggest that the exocyst is required after the initial stages
of TZ assembly and maturation for TZ function.


\section{Methods}
\subsection{Transgenic flies}
Drosophila stocks were cultured on cornmeal molasses agar medium at 25$^{\circ}$C
and 50\% humidity.
Stocks expressing $\beta$\textit{2t}::\textit{Styp}\textbackslash{SigD} (chromosome \textit{3})
and $\beta$\textit{2t}::YFP-Sktl (chromosome \textit{2})
were described previously \citep{wei2008depletion, fabian2010phosphatidylinositol}.
$\beta$\textit{2t}::mCherry-Sktl was made as in \citep{wei2008depletion},
and a \textit{P}-element insertion on chromosome \textit{2} was used for rescue using the low-level
expression vector \textit{tv3} \citep{wong2005pip2}.
Ana1-tdTomato (chromosome \textit{2}) and Cep290-GFP (chromosome \textit{3}) were provided
by T. Avidor-Reiss \citep{basiri2014migrating}.
\textit{Sp}/\textit{CyO}; Unc-GFP was originally provided by M. Kernan \citep{baker2004mechanosensory}.
Stocks expressing GFP-tagged Chibby, B9d1, B9d2, Cc2d2a and Mks1 were
provided by B. Durand \citep{enjolras2012drosophila, vieillard2016transition}.
The \textit{onr} mutant was described previously \citep{giansanti2015exocyst}.
Stocks for generating \textit{sktl}\textsuperscript{2.3} clones were originally provided by
A. Guichet \citep{gervais2008pip5k}.
\textit{w}\textsuperscript{1118} was used as the wild-type control.

\subsection{Antibodies}
The following primary antibodies were used for immunofluorescence
at the indicated concentrations -
rabbit anti-Tulp (gift from W. McGinnis \citep{ronshaugen2002structure}), 1:500;
chicken anti-GFP IgY (abcam) 1:1000;
rat anti-RFP IgG (5F8, ChromoTek), 1:1000;
rabbit anti-Sktl (courtesy of P. Raghu), 1:500;
rabbit anti-\textit{d}Sec6 (courtesy of U. Tepass), 1:500;
mouse anti-acetylated $\alpha$-tubulin 6-11-B (Sigma-Aldrich), 1:1000.
Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488- and Alexa 568-conjugated
anti-mouse, anti-rabbit and anti-chicken
IgG (Molecular Probes) at 1:1000.
DAPI was used to label chromatin at 1:1000.

\subsection{Fluorescence microscopy}
For live imaging, testes were dissected in phosphate bufferd saline (PBS).
If staining for chromatin, intact testes were incubated in PBS with
Hoechst (1:5000) for 5 minutes at this point.
Testes were transferred to a polylysine-coated glass slide in a drop of PBS,
ruptured using a syringe needle and
squashed under a glass coverslip using Kimwipes.
The edges of the coverslip were sealed with nail polish
and the specimen was visualized immediately using an epifluorescence microscope.

For Taxol treatments, testes from larvae or pupae expressing
Ana1-tdTomato; Cep290-GFP were
dissected into Shields and Sang M3 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented
with a predefined
concentration of Taxol and incubated overnight in a humidified sterile
chamber in the dark at room temperature. They were then squashed
in PBS and imaged live.

For CellMask staining, cells were spilled from testes in M3 medium onto
a sterilized glass-bottom dish that was pre-treated with sterile polylysine solution
to enable cells to adhere.
CellMask Deep Red (Invitrogen) solution (20 $\mu$g/mL) was added to the medium dropwise
immediately before visualization under a confocal microscope.

For immunochemistry, testes were dissected in PBS,
transferred to a polylysine-coated glass slide in a drop of PBS,
ruptured with a needle, squashed and frozen in liquid nitrogen for 5 minutes.
The slides were transferred to ice-cold methanol for 5-10 minutes for pre-fixation.
For staining with the anti-Sktl antibody, this pre-fixation step
was omitted to preserve cellular membranes.
Samples were fixed in 4\% paraformaldehyde in PBS,
permeabilized and blocked in PBS with 0.1\% Triton-X and 0.3\% bovine
serum albumin and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4$^{\circ}$C.
followed by three 5-minute washes with PBS and 1 hour incubation
with secondary antibodies and three 5-minute washes with PBS.
Samples were mounted in Dako (Agilent) and imaged with
a Leica widefield microscope
or Nikon A1R scanning confocal microscope (SickKids imaging facility).

\subsection{Statistical methods}
Statistical analysis and graphing was performed using R (version 3.4)
\citep{r}.
A Gaussian jitter was applied when plotting
results in Figures 1 and 2 for clearer visualization of trends,
but raw data was used for all analysis.
Statistical tests for ``absence of phenotype'' were computed under a
hypothesis assuming binomial likelihood (i.e. assuming a fixed probability of the
phenotype occurring).
All $t$-tests were unpaired and two-sided.
A significance level of 0.01 was fixed \textit{a priori} for all classical analysis.
All raw data and code for analysis and plotting can be found online
at \url{http://www.github.com/alindgupta/germline-paper/}.

\subsection{Phylogenetic analysis}
Candidate orthologs of Skittles or PIP5K9B were queried
from Inparanoid and FlyBase (version 8.0).
Poorly annotated protein sequences were confirmed
to encode type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate
kinases using reciprocal BLAST search.
Phylogeny.fr (\url{http://www.phylogeny.fr}) was used for
phylogenetic reconstruction with T-Coffee for multiple alignment
and MrBayes for tree construction.
The output was converted to a vector image in Illustrator
and colours were added for the purpose of illustration.
